Repository for code for ECE373 Project 1 - Go Fish

As a reminder of what our classes are:
Player Class
Game Class
Deck Class
ComputerPlayer Class
Error Class

It would be really helpful to me if we could all keep our code up to date on here.
That way we can all check in on what we're doing.
This way there is also some accountability and incentive to get our code done. 

Let me know if you need any help with the git commit process.
